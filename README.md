# Lorem ipsum stopwords
A collection of stopwords that can be used to clean texts from Lorem Ipsum-style fillers.

### Usage
Read the comma-separated file into a stopword list. 

**Note:** Depending on your target language, there are many words that overlap with natural language. Please inspect the list manually first.

### Background
I was analysing natural language in a trove of documents  when I stumbled upon the frustration of having to deal with pre-filled out layout pages. Usually they were created with the default ["lorem ipsum"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lorem_ipsum) text, but I soon discovered variants that used other latin texts. 

To spare someone out there the hassle of trying to remove them manually, I put all the words I could find in a single file so that it can be used as a stopword list. 

Feel free to share however you want.
